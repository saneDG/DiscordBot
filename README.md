Bot for playing music in discord

You can connect bot for your server using [this](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=518859312781852692&permissions=0&scope=bot) link.

You have to be in the voice channel that you want bot to jooint and play music.

**COMMANDS:**

- .ping - see if bot is online. it should return 'pong!'
- .helppi√§ - see the commands for the bot
- .tule - bot joins to voice channel you are currently in
- .heippa - bot leaves the voice channel
- .soita 'URL HERE' - plays music from url you give
- .jono 'URL HERE' - adds music to queue
- .skippi - skips current song

The bot is not online quite often but you can use my code to create your own music bot by adding your bot token in the code.

**PewDiePie vs T-Series**

Added new feature to view battle between two most subscribed youtube channels. With command: ".pvst" you see both channels subscriber count and their subcap.
